Exercise 1
You probably already use it but if you don't, install it. For this exercise we're going to use VSCode's live-server extension, which allows us to have a running backend in a few seconds.

Create a new directory , containing 3 files:

index.html
script.js
a json file containing an array with a few strings ( learn what's a json file )
Create a button balise , when clicked the json's contentn is loaded with a fetch('your-json-file.json'), then dynamically generate a ul list containing each rule in a li .
